# üíª About Me

I'm C√©sar Rodr√≠guez, a passionate Backend Developer with three years of experience in software development, specializing in .NET Core, .NET Framework, and React.js. I have a strong background in building and managing REST APIs, developing web applications, and handling databases with Microsoft SQL Server.

My career began in 2022 as a programmer at Lancer Digital, where I applied my knowledge in real-world projects. In June 2024, I joined Roomdimensions Ib√©rica, working on large-scale international projects, developing applications for clients in the Middle East and beyond.

Throughout my journey, I have strengthened my skills in dynamic environments, collaborating with high-level teams to deliver professional-grade applications. My responsibilities include bug resolution, software testing, and the application of Agile methodologies like Scrum, ensuring product quality and on-time deliveries.
